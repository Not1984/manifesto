# Not 1984 Manifesto

- We lived in a unsecure world. We want a safer place to live.
- We have govements that tend to disrespect privacy of the individuals. We want avoid that.

## The problem

Security monitoring and vigilance is based in a very repetitive human tasks and it is very expensive:

- Identification of people
- Authorization of action
- Intrusion detection
- Lock and unlock gates
- Call police in case of an incident

Public security Intelligence is a complex task that combine repetitive and non repetitive tasks. It depends on their own database and third-party databases. The iteration between these two kinds of database is crucial and yet has legal and moral limitations. The privacy right should be preserved. On the other hand the we want be better protected and want help on that.

## Proposed Solution

### Private sector

To help to provide a better private security monitoring and vigilance we will help to create an automated security monitoring and vigilance that will execute the repetitive task on human behalf with a human supervision. This system will have:

- Local cameras and image with a distributed processing based on AI models.
- Local communication devices (tablets or similar) or mobile apps to communicate with the units.
- Local data storage to keep data for short time
- Local controls in the gates.
- Cloud data storage to keep data for a long time
- Central of supervision of all images and data processing and retraining

All automated operation should be made with a certain level of confidence and all other cases will be redirected to the human supervision that will decide and classified the context, helping to get more accuracy in future predictions.

### Public sector

We want provide tools to the public sector. The public security monitoring and vigilance will runs similarly with the private sector. It should be decentralized image processing. Each group of cameras will have a model provided by the central and will have own storage for a short time. This system will automate the repeatable tasks and will detect common risk situation.

- Intrusion detection
- Robbery detection
- Harassment detection
- Tag unidentified people with location and time to further search. This has a serious moral and legal discussion. We don't have a final option on that.

## The negotiation protocol

When security forces with the given authority needs search some person of interest usually look into their own database and request private data as needed. That takes time and in many occasions the data is already gone.

Private people and companies wants to be notified if some wanted people shows into their properties but **they want to keep the privacy** of their homes and places.

The proposal is a protocol that will help both sides and keep their mains goals protected:

- Public sector wants faster investigation
- Private sector wants protect their privacy.

1. A message with the search model will be broadcasted to probable locations.
2. A distributed search will be executed and if a match happens that will happen:
   **A**: If it's not secrety investigation, protected by law, the landlord will be notified that a match happens and give them the opportunity to send an answer back or not.
   If decide to send, only metadata will be sent. Images will be only sent with a warranty.
   **B**: If it's a secret investigation protected by law the query request was sent with the warranty signature and the landlord will only be notified, but the results will send back automatically.
